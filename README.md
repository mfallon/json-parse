JavaScript JSON Parse

A Simple JavaScript JSON Parse app using the OpenWeatherMap API to produce a 5 Day Weather Forecast.

Enter a city name into the search field and a JSON request is sent to retrieve city names from the service.
Hitting search will request the 5 day forcast for the provided city.

Future Improvements:

    1 - Effecient way to do city lookups that don't result in network overhead
    2 - Detail view on each day to get more in depth stats that are available in response anyway
    3 - Theme/Style: Add icons for weather types and change background depending on weather
    4 - Fixes around interactivity and messages of text input (autocomplete)
    5 - Utilise some transitions/effects for display and interactivity
